<h2>Defang and Refang</h2>
<p>  

Defang

Defanging a URL will prevent the users from clicking a malicious link.

This aims to defang URLs and IP addresses in one click.  
  
To defang a URL,
  
- “http” will be replaced with “hxxp”
- “ftp” will be replaced with “fxp”
- Brackets will be added to domain names; for example, www.google.com will be replaced with www[.]google[.]com
- Brackets will be added to IP addresses; for example, 8.8.8.8 will be replaced with 8[.]8[.]8[.]8


Refang

In a security steup where these malicious URLs and IP addresses will be added to blocking,the true URLs and IPs need to be refanged.
This replaces the defanged content and reverts to the original state of the URL/IP.

In communicating via email containing malicious links, it is recommended to defang malicious indicators, however in instances where further analysis and investigation is needed on the malicous indicator, a defanged URL/IP is nedded.
